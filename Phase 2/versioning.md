# API Versioning Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the versioning strategy used in our API to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions for API consumers.

## Version Format
We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0 with the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version increments indicate new functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version increments indicate backward-compatible bug fixes

## API Version Communication

### URL Versioning
The API version is communicated through the URL path:
```
https://api.example.com/v1/resources
```

### Headers
Additionally, we include version information in response headers:
```
API-Version: 1.0.0
```

## Version Lifecycle

### Version States
1. **Active** - Current recommended version
2. **Deprecated** - Still functional but scheduled for removal
3. **Sunset** - No longer supported

### Timeline
- New versions are announced 3 months before release
- Deprecated versions are supported for 6 months after deprecation notice
- End-of-life versions are communicated 12 months in advance

## Breaking Changes
Breaking changes that trigger a MAJOR version increment include:
- Removing or renaming endpoints
- Changing response structure
- Modifying request parameter requirements
- Changing authentication methods

## Version Support Policy
- We maintain support for the current version and one previous major version
- Security patches are backported to all supported versions
- Bug fixes are typically only applied to the latest version

## Documentation
- Each API version has its own documentation
- Changes between versions are documented in a changelog
- Migration guides are provided for major version upgrades

## Testing
- All supported versions have automated test suites
- Cross-version compatibility tests are run for backward-compatible changes
- Integration tests verify version-specific behaviors

## Client Libraries
- Client libraries are versioned independently
- Library versions clearly indicate compatible API versions
- Breaking changes in libraries follow the same versioning principles

## Emergency Changes
For critical security fixes:
- Patches are applied to all supported versions
- Changes are documented in security advisories
- Clients are notified through established communication channels
